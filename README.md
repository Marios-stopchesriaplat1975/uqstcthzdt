Dude, just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘦𝘥 iHostage and I gotta say, I'm feeling all sorts of ways about it. It was like, tense AF, but at the same time, kinda predictable, you know? You can practically see the plot twists coming. I mean, I’m not mad about it, but also, was that really surprising? Eh, not really.

The whole time I was thinking, Am I 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 a thriller or a freakin' geology lecture with how much they kept drilling details into you! Like, it’s hard enough telling people apart when you're more used to identifying layers of rocks haha. But seriously, those characters, can we talk about how some of them had the emotional depth of gravel?

> And don’t even get me started on the pacing. One moment I'm biting my nails, next thing I'm like, Yawn, when's snack time? It was a rollercoaster that got stuck mid-loop, you know what I mean? 

Remember when I had that idea to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   last week? Yeah, I should've just 𝘴𝘵𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘮ed it. The quality was meh, but hey, it was 𝘧𝘳𝘦𝘦, so who's complaining, right? But hey, some of those scenes were decent, I'll give them that.

Oh, and that lead guy definitely had some acting chops going, even if they made him do that whole look into the distance dramatically every 10 mins. If I had a nickel for every time he did that... well, I wouldn't be rich but I'd have enough for a nice cup of coffee.

Plus, I've been trying to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   without my brain turning into mush from overanalyzing EVERYTHING. Like, why can't I just enjoy something without picking apart every damn thing? Blame the geologist in me, I swear.

Anyway, long story short, not the   of the year but whatever, I've seen worse. Now let's just randomly throw this in there: `for(int i = 0; i < 5; i++) { Console.WriteLine(Why am I doing this?); }` Haha, don't even know why I remember that from code class, but there you go.

Alright, I’m out. Gonna hit the sack and dream of rocks or something more exciting. Catch you later!
